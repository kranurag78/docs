<p>The Kubernetes Cluster API Provider Hetzner enables declarative provisioning of multiple Kubernetes clusters on <a href="https://hetzner.cloud" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hetzner infrastructure</a>.</p>
<p>High-available Kubernetes clusters on bare metal and cloud instances are supported.</p>
<p>The Cluster API simplifies the creation, updates, and operation of production-ready clusters.
Self-managed Kubernetes clusters can, therefore, be easily operated even at a large scale.</p>

<h2>📰 What is the Cluster API Provider Hetzner?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cluster API</a> orchestrates infrastructure similar to the way Kubernetes manages containers. It implements a declarative API like Kubernetes does and extends the resources of the Kubernetes API server via CRDs.</p>
<p>The Cluster API consists of the CAPI controller, the control-plane provider, the bootstrap provider,
and an infrastructure provider.</p>
<p>The controllers ensure that the desired state of the infrastructure is achieved - just as Kubernetes ensures the desired state of containers. The concept of
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes Controller</a> has significant advantages over Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solutions because it can react automatically to changes and problems. The best example of this is the MachineHealthCheck, which replaces unhealthy nodes automatically.</p>
<p>Using the Cluster API Provider Hetzner (CAPH) unites the benefits of declarative infrastructure, cost-effectiveness, and (GDPR-compliant) European cloud.</p>

</ul>
<h2>👀 Clarifying Scope</h2>
<p>If you are new to Kubernetes, we want you to know that managing a production-grade Kubernetes system requires a <strong>dedicated team of experts</strong>.</p>
<p>The Cluster API Provider Hetzner (CAPH) deals with the lifecycle management of machines and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Here are several aspects that CAPH will not handle for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>production-ready node images</li>
<li>secured kubeadm configuration</li>
<li>incorporation of cluster add-ons, such as CNI (e.g. cilium), metrics-server, konnectivity-service, etc.</li>
<li>testing &amp; update procedures of Kubernetes version, configuration</li>
<li>backup procedures</li>
<li>monitoring strategies</li>
<li>alerting systems</li>
<li>identity and Access Management (IAM)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't have a dedicated team for managing Kubernetes, you can use <strong>Syself Autopilot</strong> and enjoy a multitude of benefits including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistent, regular updates that allow you to access the latest features.</li>
<li>Reduction in workload for your DevOps team as Syself takes over the responsibility of maintaining the system, ensuring seamless updates, and creating new clusters quickly and efficiently.</li>
<li>Expertise in dealing with the Cluster API and Hetzner, enabling quicker resolution of issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2>🚀 Get Started</h2>
<p>If you're looking to jump straight into it, go ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="docs/topics/quickstart.md" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Cluster API Provider Hetzner 15 Minute Tutorial</strong></a>: Set up a bootstrap cluster using Kind and deploy a Kubernetes cluster on Hetzner</li>
<li><a href="docs/developers/development.md" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Develop and test Kubernetes clusters with Tilt</strong></a>: Start using Tilt for rapid testing of various cluster flavors, like with/without a private network or bare metal.</li>
<li><a href="docs/topics/node-image.md" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Develop and test own node-images</strong></a>: How to use your own machine images for production systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the pure creation and operation of Kubernetes clusters, this provider can also validate and approve certificate signing requests. This increases security as the kubelets of the nodes can be operated with signed certificates. This enables the metrics-server to run securely. <a href="docs/topics/advanced-caph.md#csr-controller" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a> to read more about the CSR controller.</p>

<p>Test status:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>✓</code> tested</li>
<li><code>+</code> should work, but we weren't able to test it</li>
</ul>
<p>Each version of Cluster API for Hetzner will attempt to support at least two Kubernetes versions.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> As the versioning for this project is tied to the versioning of Cluster API, future modifications to this policy may be made to more closely align with other providers in the Cluster API ecosystem.</p>

<h2>:white_square_button: Operating System Images</h2>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Cluster API Provider Hetzner relies on a few prerequisites, which have to be already installed in the used operating system images, e.g. a container runtime, kubelet, and Kubeadm. Reference images can be found in kubernetes-sigs/image-builder and <a href="templates/node-image" rel="noopener noreferrer">templates/node-image</a>. If it isn't possible to pre-install these prerequisites in the image, you can always deploy and execute some custom scripts through the Kubeadm config. <a href="docs/topics/node-image.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more...</a></p>
